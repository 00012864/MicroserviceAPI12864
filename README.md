Products
The products.xlsx file is for inserting the products to sql server. When the Excel file gets saved as a CSV file and then imported to Sql Server, the product table should be created, along with the list of products. Howver, the foreign key query should be added after inserting the products list because it is necessary for showing the category of each product. 

Categories
The file for creating the categories table inludes the sql statements necessary to create the categories table and there is also the file with the sql queries to insert the list of categories. 
Both the queries for (creating the table and inserting the category values) should be executed.
